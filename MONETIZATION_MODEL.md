## 9. Pricing Psychology

**Value Framing:**
```
Wrong: "Premium Plan: 20,000 BIF/month"
Right: "Premium Plan: Only 667 BIF/day for unlimited exposure!"
```

3. **Expired Listing**: "Your listing expired. Repost as Featured for better results!"
4. **Competitor Success**: "Similar listings sold 5x faster with Featured placement"
